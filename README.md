# HelloWorldCorp
HelloWorldCorp is an organization that develops an application to receive a value from the user, check it for correctness and output. The organization is happy to accept additions among the members of the GitHub community.

Project functionality:
1. Getting a value: The program requests a value from the user using the command line or the user interface.
2. Correctness check: The project checks the new value for compliance with certain criteria, such as data type, length, the presence of certain characters, etc. If the entered value does not meet the specified criteria, the corresponding error is reported.
Value output: If the entered value passes verification, the program displays it on the screen or saves it to a file, depending on the settings you set.

Using the project:
1. Installation: To use the project, you should clone the repository from GitHub or download it as an archive.
2. Launch: Run the main script.py using the Python interpreter.
3. Entering a value: Follow the instructions to enter a value. The project will check the entered value and issue the appropriate messages.

#FIXME: Unfortunately, at the moment the program does not perform the required actions. We are working on improving it and trying to provide a wider range of functions in the future. We apologize for any inconvenience. If you have any questions or need help with something, please let us know.

Project expansion:
You can extend the functionality of the project by adding additional rules and checks for values, or by configuring output methods.
